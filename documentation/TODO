There are many things to implement in the game, here are listed some of them ranked by difficulty.

EASY:

- Writing a README file:
Currently, there is no README file, also because the project doesn't have a clear outline yet.

- Code refactoring:
It's possible that sometimes code that doesn't conform to the style guidelines defined in STYLE will be pushed to the repository.
Finding that code, and fixing it so that it conforms to the guidelines would be a nice way of getting your hands
on the project for the first time and a big help to maintainers.

- Documentation:
One of the goals of the project is to be as welcoming as possible to new contributions, this can't really be the case without good
documentation. Engine APIs, modding interfaces and modules of the code (rendering, vulkan, ecs, mods, ...) should be
documented with text files in `documentation/` and in the documentation page of the website (TODO).

- Unit testing:
Zig has built-in unit testing which should be used to verify that everything is working correctly when changing something.

MEDIUM:

- Window resizing:
Currently the game window isn't resizable. Resizing should be implemented in all the platform specific code (wayland, xorg, macos).

HARD:
